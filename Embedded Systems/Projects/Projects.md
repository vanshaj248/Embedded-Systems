## 1. Power Bank (using Li-ion Battery to Create a Power Bank from Scratch)

### Power Bank Overview

A power bank stores electrical energy and provides it to devices through USB. This project involves building a power bank using Li-ion batteries from scratch.

### Power Bank Components Needed

- Li-ion batteries (18650 cells preferred)
- Battery holder for 18650 cells
- Battery protection circuit (BMS: Battery Management System)
- Boost converter (to step up voltage to 5V for USB output)
- Micro USB or USB-C input for charging the batteries
- USB output ports
- Heat shrink wrap or enclosure box
- Soldering iron and tools

### Power Bank Steps

1. **Battery Selection & Configuration**:

   - Use high-quality 18650 Li-ion batteries.
   - Connect them in parallel for increased capacity, making sure the total output voltage matches the boost converter input.

2. **Battery Management System (BMS)**:

   - Connect the BMS to protect the batteries from overcharging and over-discharging.

3. **Boost Converter**:

   - Attach a boost converter circuit to step up the battery voltage (typically 3.7V) to 5V for the USB output.

4. **Assemble Input & Output Ports**:
   - Connect the USB output port to the boost converter.
   - Connect the Micro-USB/USB-C port to the charging input.

5. **Enclosure**:
   - Pack the setup inside a heat shrink or a custom-made enclosure.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test by charging and discharging with various devices.

### Power Bank Tools Needed

- Multimeter
- Soldering iron
- Heat shrink tubing

## 2. NAS (Network-Attached Storage with a Linux Developer Environment)

### Overview

A NAS system allows you to store and share files across a network. In this project, we will build a NAS that also acts as a Linux development environment.

### Components Needed

- Old PC or Raspberry Pi
- External hard drives or SSDs
- SATA-to-USB cables (for Raspberry Pi)
- Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi adapter
- Linux distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, or any NAS-focused distribution like OpenMediaVault)
- Power supply (appropriate for Raspberry Pi or PC)

### Steps

1. **Install Linux OS**:
   - Install Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) or a NAS-focused OS (e.g., OpenMediaVault) on the system.

2. **Set Up Network File System (NFS)**:
   - Install NFS and configure the shared folders for network access.

3. **RAID Configuration (Optional)**:
   - Set up RAID for data redundancy if using multiple disks.

4. **Install Developer Tools**:
   - Install `gcc`, `make`, `git`, and other essential tools for software development.

5. **Access Control**:
   - Set up user permissions to control access to the NAS.

6. **Test & Access NAS**:
   - Access the NAS from a remote device using an IP address or hostname.

### Tools Needed

- PC/Server or Raspberry Pi setup with SSH access
- Storage drives connected to the system
- Router or switch for network connectivity

## 3. DIY Flipper Zero

Flipper Zero is a multi-tool for geeks, used for hardware hacking. This project will focus on building your own simplified version.

### Components Needed

- Raspberry Pi Zero or similar microcontroller
- 3.5mm OLED display
- Button interface (physical buttons or touch)
- RF transceiver (for 433 MHz signals)
- IR transmitter and receiver module
- NFC reader module
- SD card for file storage
- Enclosure (3D printed or purchased)

### Steps

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the display, button interface, RF transceiver, and IR module to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
   - Attach the NFC module to read/write NFC tags.

2. **Software Development**:
   - Install Raspberry Pi OS or a lightweight Linux OS.
   - Write Python scripts to interface with each module (RF transceiver, IR module, NFC reader).
   - Develop a simple menu-driven UI to interact with the different functions.

3. **Integrate Functionality**:
   - Create scripts for RF signal transmission, IR communication, and NFC tag reading.

4. **Enclosure & Testing**:
   - Pack everything into a custom enclosure.
   - Test by sending RF signals, reading NFC tags, and capturing IR transmissions.

### Tools Needed

- Soldering iron
- Python for software development
- 3D printer for custom enclosure (optional)
