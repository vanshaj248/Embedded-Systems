# Embedded Systems Roadmap & Projects

Welcome to my Embedded Systems journey! This repository outlines my learning roadmap and showcases my projects that demonstrate the skills and knowledge I’ve gained in the field of embedded systems. 

## Roadmap for Embedded Systems

This roadmap highlights the key areas I’m focusing on to master embedded systems. Each section contains a brief overview and related subtopics.

### 1. Introduction to Embedded Systems
**What are Embedded Systems?**
Embedded systems are specialized computing systems that perform dedicated tasks or functions within a larger system. They typically combine hardware and software designed for real-time operations.

- Microcontrollers vs. Microprocessors
- Real-time operating systems (RTOS)
- Applications of embedded systems in various industries

### 2. Soft Skills for Embedded Engineers
Embedded engineers, like other professionals, require a range of soft skills to thrive in their work environment. These skills help navigate workplace challenges and foster effective communication and collaboration.

- **Problem-Solving:** Ability to troubleshoot hardware and software issues.
- **Adaptability:** Flexibility in handling different tools, environments, and technologies.
- **Communication:** Clear communication of technical details to team members and stakeholders.
- **Teamwork:** Collaborating on multidisciplinary teams.
- **Time Management:** Prioritizing tasks and managing time effectively for project completion.

> Improving soft skills takes continuous effort and self-awareness. It involves recognizing your strengths and working on areas for improvement over time.

### 3. Electronics Fundamentals
Understanding the basics of electronics is crucial for any embedded engineer. This includes mastering the principles behind electrical circuits and components, which are the foundation of embedded hardware.

- **Basic Calculus:** Important for analyzing circuit behavior.
- **Principles of Electrical Circuits:** Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, and circuit components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
- **Digital Design:** Logic gates, flip-flops, counters, and state machines.
- **Computer Architecture:** Basics of CPU design, memory hierarchy, buses, and instruction sets.

### 4. Using Test Equipment
Embedded engineers must be comfortable using test equipment to diagnose issues, validate designs, and ensure that systems are working as expected.

- **Multimeter:** Measuring voltage, current, resistance, and continuity.
- **Logic/Protocol Analyzer:** Analyzing digital communication protocols.
- **Oscilloscope:** Observing the changing signal voltages and diagnosing signal integrity issues.

### 5. Prototyping Skills
Creating functional prototypes is a key part of the embedded system design process. These skills help engineers turn ideas into physical devices and test them for functionality.

- **Breadboarding:** Quickly testing circuit designs before building permanent versions.
- **Hardware Design Basics:** Understanding schematics, components, and design principles.
- **PCB Design / EMC:** Laying out printed circuit boards and ensuring electromagnetic compatibility.
- **Soldering / Rework:** Assembling and modifying hardware components.
